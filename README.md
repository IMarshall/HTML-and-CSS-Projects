# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
Projects from the HTML and CSS Course I'm taking through the Tech Academy

## Introduction
In this repository, I'll be storing projects I create while taking the HTML and CSS course through the Tech Academy. Some projects may be small, with the sole purpose of demonstrating understanding of a single concept. Other projects might be larger, used to demonstrate the use of many different skills.
